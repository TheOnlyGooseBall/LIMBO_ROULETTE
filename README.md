LIMBO ROULETTE

Limbo Roulette is a psychological horror duel disguised as a game of chance. You sit across from a silent Dealer. A rotating chamber of live rounds, blanks, and timed fuses decides who survives each turn.

But this is not just Russian roulette.

You have a Nerve meter. Every explosion, ticking fuse, and close call erodes your mental stability. As your Nerve drops, your perception becomes unreliable. Your aim may flip. You may hallucinate the next shell. Panic becomes a mechanic.
