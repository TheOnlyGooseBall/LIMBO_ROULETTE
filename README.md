#LIMBO ROULETTE

is a psychological duel disguised as a retro RPG encounter.

You sit across from a silent Dealer inside a dark, CRT-lit void. A revolver chamber spins between you. Some shells are live. Some are blanks. Some carry unstable fuses that detonate after a delay. Every decision carries risk, and every mistake compounds pressure.

The game plays out across six escalating rounds. Each round increases the number of shells and the Dealer’s resilience. Live rounds become more common. Fuses stack. Tension rises. There is no randomness without consequence — probability is weaponized.

The interface mimics a classic 16-bit battle system. You select FIGHT, ACT, ITEM, or MERCY — but most options offer little comfort. FIGHT determines who faces the next chamber. A blank may grant momentum. A live round ends momentum immediately. A fuse turns the fight into a countdown.

After surviving six rounds, the gun falls silent. You face a final door. Several keys appear. Only one unlocks escape. You have limited attempts. Choose wrong, and the door reshuffles. Choose correctly, and you leave Limbo.

The core theme is not survival by strength. It is survival under pressure.
Control erodes. Risk compounds. Composure determines outcome.
