LIMBO ROULETTE

LIMBO ROULETTE is a browser-based psychological roulette duel built with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript. Inspired by retro RPG battle systems and CRT-era visuals, the game blends chance, tension, and escalating risk into a fast-paced encounter against a silent Dealer.

Overview

You face a revolver chamber loaded with a mix of live rounds, blanks, and timed fuses. Each round increases difficulty — more shells, higher danger probability, and a stronger opponent.

The game progresses through six escalating rounds. Survive them all, and you reach the Final Door: a key trial where only one choice leads to escape.

There is no mercy system. There is no negotiation. Only probability and composure.
