# LIMBO_ROULETTE

Limbo Roulette is a fast-paced psychological horror duel disguised as a game of chance. You sit across from a silent Dealer. A shotgun rotates between you. Some shells are live. Some are blanks. Some attach timed fuses to your body.

But survival isn’t just about avoiding bullets.

You have a Nerve meter. Every explosion, ticking fuse, and close call damages your mental stability. As your Nerve drops:

– Your aim may flip without warning
– You may hallucinate the next shell
– Your decisions become unreliable
– The final escape becomes harder

You must survive multiple escalating rounds against the Dealer. Even if you defeat him, you are not free. The final door is locked. Your mental state determines how many keys you must choose from. Choose wrong too many times, and you remain in Limbo.

This is not just about luck. It is about risk control under psychological pressure.

#How to Play

#Objective
Survive three rounds against the Dealer and pass the final Key Trial.

#Core Mechanics

#Shooting
On your turn, you may:
– Shoot yourself
– Shoot the Dealer
– Use an item

If you shoot:
– Live shell = 1 damage
– Blank = no damage
– Fuse shell = attaches a timed explosive (detonates after X turns)

Fuse explosions deal heavy damage and reduce Nerve.

#Nerve System

Nerve represents your mental stability.

High Nerve:
– Clear information
– Stable inputs
– Easier final escape

Low Nerve:
– Controls may flip
– Shell information may be false
– Harder key selection at the end

If Nerve collapses, the game becomes more chaotic.

#Items

You may receive items each round:

Pills — restore Nerve
Mirror — peek at the next shell
Pliers — remove one active fuse (costs Nerve)

Use items carefully. You only get a few.

#Dealer

The Dealer shoots strategically and can force fuse shells onto you. Later rounds escalate difficulty. After each round:
– Dealer health increases
– Your maximum Nerve permanently decreases

Pressure builds over time.

#The Final Door — Key Trial

If you survive all rounds, you must choose the correct key.

The lower your Nerve:
– The more keys appear
– The harder escape becomes

You have 3 attempts. Wrong answers reshuffle the correct key.
